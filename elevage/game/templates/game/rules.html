    <h1 class="mb-4 text-primary">🐰 Game Rules – Rabbit Farm Management</h1>

    <p>This is a turn-based strategy game where players manage a rabbit farm. The objective is to make optimal use of limited resources through careful planning and decision-making.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-5">🎯 Resources</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Number of rabbits (males and females)</li>
        <li>Reproduction and sales</li>
        <li>Amount of food</li>
        <li>Number of cages</li>
        <li>Available money</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="mt-5">🚀 Game Start</h2>
    <p>At the beginning of the game, the player selects starting quantities for all resources from a setup page.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-5">🔁 Turn Structure</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Each turn represents 1 month.</li>
        <li>The player can:
            <ul>
                <li>Buy food (1 unit = 1 kg)</li>
                <li>Sell rabbits (only rabbits aged 3 months or older)</li>
                <li>Buy cages</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>When the turn ends, the game advances 1 month and automatically applies all rules (reproduction, feeding, death, etc.).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="mt-5">🐇 Reproduction Rules</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Females reach sexual maturity at 6 months old.</li>
        <li>They can give birth until 4 years of age.</li>
        <li>Gestation lasts 1 month.</li>
        <li>Each birth results in 1 to 4 baby rabbits (kits).</li>
        <li>A female can get pregnant again a few days after giving birth.</li>
        <li><strong>Extra rule:</strong> A female can only get pregnant if there is at least one male rabbit aged 3 months or older in the farm.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="mt-5">📈 Growth and Maturity</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Rabbits are considered adults at 3 months old.</li>
        <li>Only adult rabbits (3 months or older) can be sold.</li>
        <li>Older rabbits are sold before younger ones.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="mt-5">🥕 Feeding Rules</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 unit of food = 1 kg.</li>
        <li>Feeding costs per rabbit:
            <ul>
                <li>1st month: 0 (milk from mother)</li>
                <li>2nd month: 100 g/day → 3 kg/month</li>
                <li>3+ months: 250 g/day → 7.5 kg/month</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If a rabbit is not fed for an entire month, it dies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="mt-5">🏠 Cage Rules</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Each cage can hold up to 6 rabbits safely.</li>
        <li>From 10 rabbits and more in the same cage, overpopulation increases the risk of disease and death.</li>
        <li>Kits (rabbits under 1 month old) do not count towards overpopulation.</li>
    </ul>
